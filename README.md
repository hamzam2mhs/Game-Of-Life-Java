# Game-Of-Life-Java

I have written a Java code to enable a user to play a game of “Connect”, where players alternate dropping coloured playing pieces into a grid. The goal of the game is to get four of your pieces in a line (horizontal, diagonal or vertical) before the artificial intelligence does.
The Artificial intelligence decides where to insert, I have made it more defensive, but I have made it in such a way that a human player can win, you can change the difficulty in the ArtificialIntelligence class accordingly.




To compile the program:
1) Type the following command in commandprompt or terminal.
	javac HamzaMuhammadA3.java
2) Once the program is compiled then run it by typing
	java HamzaMuhammadA3

The program should run without any issues :)
